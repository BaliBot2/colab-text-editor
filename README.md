# Server

`backend` - backend related settings

`app` - to handle page navigations and creations of documents



`current issues` :
1) collaboration only works when users have joined already, new users see fresh page
2) Collaboration is not exactly realtime (have to adjust debounce)
4) storing doc data



`potential `:
1) Cursor positioning, add more options from quill side
2) OAuth
3) better UI lol
