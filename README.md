# Server

`backend` - backend related settings

`app` - to handle page navigations and creations of documents

`current issues`
-  add quill options
-  doc persistence is a little broken
-  share button generates faulty link, needs to take email as input
-  "comment" and "viewer" models

`old issues ` :
1) collaboration only works when users have joined already, new users see fresh page
2) Collaboration is not exactly realtime (have to adjust debounce)
4) storing doc data



`potential `:
1) Cursor positioning, add more options from quill side
2) OAuth
3) better UI lol
